      <h2>Immediate</h2>
      <p>
        Call <code>renew</code> without arguments to
        immediately mark a callback as invokable (this is the default state
        of all callbacks). This will have no
        effect on future callback expirations, and can be used as
        many times as needed.
      </p>
      <pre>new Callback()
.renew()</pre>
      
      <h2>Event driven</h2>
      <p>
        Similar to <a href="cancel.html"><code>cancel</code></a>,
        <code>renew</code> uses <code>when</code> under the hood, allowing
        you to use every event tool <code>when</code> supports.
        As soon as your event fires, your expired callback is renewed
        for execution.
      </p>
      <pre>new Callback( function )
.when( product, 'click' )
.cancel()
.renew( request, 'load' )</pre>
      <p>
        The above example creates a new callback, binds it to click events on
        the product, and prevents the callback from running until the
        request has come in successfully.
