      <h2>DOM events</h2>
      <p>
        After declaring a callback, you can bind it to
        a limitless number of events using "when".
      </p>
      <pre>new Callback(function)
.when( target, "event" )</pre>
      <p>
        In this case, when takes an element as a first
        parameter and an event to search for in the second.
        This might look like
        <code>( document, "click" )</code>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Promises</h3>
      <p>
        CallbackJS checks the target "ready state" of your
        <code>load</code> events. If the document/request
        etc. has already ended, your callback is fired
        immediately.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Timer events</h2>
      <p>
        <code>when</code> also takes time as an argument. Pass your
        time in milliseconds and the callback will execute
        when it ends. Also, if you want it to repeat,
        you can pass <code>true</code> afterwards.
      </p>
      <pre>new Callback()
// call once after three seconds
.when(3000)

// repeat every five seconds
.when(5000, true)</pre>

      <h2>Custom events</h2>
      <p>
        The crowning feature of CallbackJS is custom events.
        Using them with <code>when</code> is as simple as
        passing a string as your custom event name.
      </p>
      <pre>new Callback()
.when( "squirrel moves" )
.when( "drone starts" )</pre>
    </div>
