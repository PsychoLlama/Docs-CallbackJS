      <h2>What it does for you</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        CallbackJS empowers your event-driven functions,
        giving you simplified decisions, error handling,
        event binding, load promises, cancellations, and
        <em>custom</em> event listeners.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3>Cancellations</h3>
          <p>
            You can cancel and renew callbacks immediately,
            or by some event. To keep a callback from
            executing, cancel it.
          </p>
          <pre>new Callback(function)
.cancel(cancelButton, "click")</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3>Decisions</h3>
          <p>
            If you find yourself checking application
            state inside your callback, there's a better
            way. CallbackJS lets you set a conditional
            function, one that is run before your callback.
            If it returns falsey, your callback
            <em>won't</em> be invoked.
          </p>
          <pre>new Callback(function)
.if(function(arg) {
  return this.fired.length &lt; 3;
})</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3>Custom Events</h3>
          <p>
            This is the reason CallbackJS was designed.
            Although JavaScript is event oriented,
            defining your own can be a painful experience,
            and they only apply to HTML elements.

            This library gives you simple tools for
            declaring and firing your own custom events.
          </p>

.when("thing happens")</pre>
